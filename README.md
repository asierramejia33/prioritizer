# User Story:

- As a product manager, I have too many ideas to implement with limited resources to get them accomplished.

- I want the ability for a group of people to be able to vote on ideas as a way to prioritize them.

- As a user, I want the ability to be able to submit Ideas to be on a list for prioritization.

- As a user, I want the ability to vote on ideas I like so that my vote will help prioritize the idea.

- As a user, I want the ability to have multiple votes (with a limit) so I can add multiple votes to give an idea a higher priority.

- As a user, I want to know the time limit on how much time is left to vote.

- As a user, I want to see a final prioritized list of ideas ranked in order of which idea got the most votes.
